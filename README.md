### Overview of Tasks

In this repository, I have implemented a variety of networking concepts, including:

- **Hub, Switch, and Router Configurations**: Demonstrating the basic setup and functionality of these devices in a network.
- **Network Topologies**: Various topologies such as star, ring, and mesh to illustrate different network designs.
- **Static Routing**: Configuring static routes to manage traffic between different networks.
- **Dynamic Routing Protocols**: Implementing OSPF and RIP (versions 1 and 2) for dynamic routing.
- **DHCP Configuration**: Setting up a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to devices on the network.
- **VLANs**: Creating and managing Virtual Local Area Networks to segment network traffic.
- **Static NAT**: Configuring Network Address Translation to allow internal devices to communicate with external networks. 
- **Router Configuration**: Comprehensive configurations for routers to ensure proper network functionality.

### Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2**: The primary tool used for simulating network configurations.
- **Cisco Devices**: Various models of routers, switches, and hubs were utilized to create realistic network environments.
